## The Decision

Several weeks prior, **Apollo** had made racist comments, but at the time, he was just a bottom feeder, and there was no issue. He also kept claiming that, because he was Mexican, he couldn’t be racist.

**BloodyMystik**, still undecided about fully supporting **Archer Company**, noticed that Apollo was quickly rising through the ranks. So, in a very public and unprofessional manner, BloodyMystik decided to force the dictator’s hand and prevent Apollo from being promoted any further, as it would be an unbearable situation for him to remain in.

BloodyMystik released the well-guarded ammunition of Apollo’s racist comments in a way that could not be taken down, since the dictator was away that day. This allowed everyone to see the comments and weigh in, hoping to block Apollo’s promotion.

Instead, BloodyMystik had to endure a 20-minute voice chat with the dictator, where he tried to justify Apollo’s racism, claiming it wasn’t malicious, even though calling “black people monkeys” was pretty obvious to some. No action was taken, and Apollo’s promotion was merely slowed down.

After this, BloodyMystik left the server, and many active members of **TFT** jumped ship upon seeing that Apollo wouldn’t be kicked out or disciplined. This situation showed that people close to the dictator could violate the rules without fear of consequences.

The reality was that **Brandon** did not want to recruit and scalp **TFT** members. However, the Apollo situation made it clear that war was brewing, and the dictator’s aggressive behavior toward members over **Archer** was only pushing people away.

Brandon still enjoyed the influx of members and would talk shit about the dictator.

Some left, some stayed in **TFT**, and **Orka** stayed mainly to play diplomacy.

## The Silent War

**BloodyMystik** created an **Archer Company** website and redirected the **TFT** domain name to it, fueling the flames of war.

He was openly accused of maliciously purchasing the domain to screw over **TFT**, which wasn’t the case. However, during wartime, anything goes.

**TFT** had a structure that was imported by having many members from **TFT** and years of operating **TFT** against the newly formed **Archer Company**.

- **Brandon** had mission-making experience from **TFT**.
- **BloodyMystik** had technical knowledge of development and vast resources at **Archer’s** disposal.
- **Pride** had the golden month to recruit new members.
- **Orka** had technical expertise and prior experience in community building, which was pivotal in shaping and structuring **BSL** today.

A **Tit for Tat** campaign ensued:
- **Warning Campaigns** under every **TFT** recruitment post.
- Alerts that members were above the rules, and donations only benefited the owner.
- Tracking the dictator’s every move on **Steam**, even getting him banned from **Steam discussions** for a few days.

The situation turned into a **bloodbath**.

## Caesar Wins

**Orka** became increasingly critical of **Brandon’s** behavior towards certain members, especially as he began copying the tactics of **TFT** and becoming just as bad as the dictator. Only two weeks in...

The next morning, **Orka** was banned, **BloodyMystik** was banned, and later that day, **Brandon nuked the server**.

All the hours of development by **BloodyMystik** and **Orka** were gone. All the work done by **Pride**, **Sammy**, and others was lost.

Initially, **BloodyMystik** had predicted that **Bryson** would be the problem, but to his surprise, Bryson remained level-headed and proved to be a great second-in-command who mitigated issues with the neo-dictator, **Brandon**. Bryson understood the bigger picture and was ready to work toward achieving it.

The death of **Archer** also marked the death of **Bryson’s** growth, maturity, and respect.

**BloodyMystik** once said: 
> "If Bryson had put the same effort into **BSL** as he did in **Archer**, he would have been a top G. It’s such a waste to see a guy with such potential being affected by petty parties and an asshole like Brandon."

Two weeks in, **Archer** was no more. The good news spread back to **TFT**, and it was seen as a victory. **TFT** was preparing a welcome-back wagon, apology letters, and defeated faces.
