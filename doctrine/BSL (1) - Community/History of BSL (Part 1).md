# The Founders
Everyone likes a little bit of drama here and there, this is ours!

Broken Skull Lunatics was founded by [BloodyMystik](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971902294/), [Sammy Dorito](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971902294/), [Orka](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198268088665/) and [Just1n](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Just1n_L/) on April 1st, 2024 and was not an April fool i promise!.

## The Donation System
BSL has a unique donation system rarely seen elsewhere! 

None of the BSL owners benefits from donations and all donations are used exclusively to provide services and content for the community!

Therefore, a budget must be approved by the donating members and the money must be used to provides goodies, materials and services such as servers, licenses and more. 

None of which benefit its owners.

Members can donate by providing servers and services free of charge to the community and BSL owned services are handle solely by the Ultimate Discord Owner through the council command which answers to the voted budget.

# Critical Events
This is the chronological order of the events that led to the creation of Broken Skull Lunatics and anyone else telling you a different story is a lying bastard! 


## The TFT Meet Up!
BloodyMystik, Sammy Dorito, Orka and Just1n all met in a unit call TFT abbreviated not to advertise that bullshit of a unit.

TFT was a dictatorship like many other units out there and the first Arma 3 unit for some of us. Nothing is wrong with that whenever a dictator is level headed, intelligent, not full of himself threaten and paranoid.

Don't get me wrong, TFT brought great benefits to us all and an expectation of a level of commitment still reflected today in BSL... you cannot erase a zebra stripes.

Brandon what we would call here at BSL a community organizer, he created Arma 3 missions for casual or during different days than TFT regular events but we had no way to announce those events nor had a dedicated section in TFT to handle announcement and various other thing related to community generated content.

## The War Party Coup
Following frustration of limitation, after attempting to gain a TFT section for the community to grow, Orka created the War Party discord to fulfill the need of the growing community, without any malice of what so ever where Brandon could host and announce the community made mission as we did not have any other ways to do that in TFT.

This is the testament of how a stubborn wanna be marine playing dictator is causing is own community fracture year after year the cycle keeps repeating...

For BloodyMystik and Orka, the War Party was an avenue of testing out a mod called Special Operation Framework long in development and in dying need of active multiplayer testing which TFT could not provide as the dictator saw Spec-Ops as trash without any will to support it... it shows how one boy can pull down a collective work to ensure he is the top g at the expanse of the wonders that can come out of a collaborating community.

Understand this, BloodyMystik is a professional developer and developers generally have that culture of collaboration to the betterment of the collective goal. This is how we make development project secure and safe by sharing and building on top of each other.

War Party was seen a Coup attempt which was lies spread by the Apollo to tap into the dictator's paranoia, whom will be recurring name in the story, the dictator lackey trying to gain trust and rank within the organization which was a definitive blow in TFT second or third fracture in years, one of the biggest migration they ever had.

Ultimately War Party was closed in favor of a section within TFT to announce, share modlists and organize community made event in addition access to the server and teamspeak for Brandon's operations.

Actions of a mad man reacting to his paranoia because he understood that Brandon had extreme pull after having built strong bonds with the community members... 

## The War Party Aftermath

After Brandon's return to TFT with all the bell and whistles, the dictator takes the whole deal as a dodged bullet and because he always takes the wrong conclusion out of situations and refuses to change he cannot see what is yet to come. 

What he did not see tho is that the damages to him and brandon's relationship were broken beyond repair after the rotten dictator questioned Brandon's integrity and accused him of orchestrating a coup which was not the case.

Bloody's logo making for War Party and Logo shattered after war party disbanded did absolutely not help smoothing things over if anything it confirmed in his mind that war party was indeed a coup and hated our awesome logos!

The arrangement was Brandon can host missions on the TFT server and use TFT teamspeak but any other member had the Bloody's teamspeak  and orka's server which put the rest of us in the semi-similar position than before...

Brandon was managing community games and Zeusing regular events.

But after many draining work and draining patience to pull up with the dictator's bullshit and comments on community made ops are more or less bad and antistasi makes bad unit players... all sort of premade half cock bullshit having effect of a growing resentment for the guy across the community....
