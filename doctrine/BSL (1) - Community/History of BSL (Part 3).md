## The Decision
Apollo has made some racist comments several weeks prior but he was a bottom feeder then... there was no issue! Plus since he is Mexican he cannot be racist, so he keeps saying.

BloodyMystik, still on the fence about making the full move to support Archer Company, see that Apollo is on the fast track up... so BloodyMystik decides in a very public and unprofessional manner in an attempt to force the hand of the dictator and ensure Apollo will never get promoted to where he wanna be as it would be an absolute shame an unbearable position for BloodyMystik to stay in...

Bloody deploys the well guarded ammunition of the racist comments made by the so called Apollo in a way where in cannot be taking down because the dictator was away that day and everyone could see and weight in to block that fucker...

Instead, BloodyMystik had to listen the dictator in a Voice chat for 20 minutes explaining why Apollo's racisms was not malicious even tho calling "black people monkeys" is pretty obvious to some of us... and no action would be taken but promotion would be slowed down...

BloodyMystik left the server shortly and TFT active members jumped ship after having seen Apollo would not be kicked out or disciplined for that matter which met beloved people by the dictator could violate the rules without any fear of rules being applied to them... bottom line is getting rid of Apollo would have weakened Brandon ability to  concretize more his members and prosperity.

Reality was Brandon did not want to recruit and scalp TFT members... he was not gonna prevent it but Apollo situation made it clear that war was brewing and the aggressive behavior of the dictator towards members over Archer was pushing people away even more.

It did not prevent Brandon from enjoying influx and talk shit about the dictator.


Some left and some stay over TFT, Orka stay to mostly play diplomacy.

## The Silent War
BloodyMystik made an Archer Company website and redirected TFT domain name to it which fueled the burning fire of war.

Bloody has been openly accused of maliciously to have purchased the domain initially to screw TFT over which was not the case but during war time anything is permitted.

TFT had the structure which was imported by having many member from TFT and the years of operating TFT against the freshly born unit.

Brandon had mission making experience gathered from the way TFT made mission.

BloodyMystik had the technical knowledge of development and lots of resources at  disposal that Archer was willing to enjoy.

Pride had the month of gold to recruit new people.

Orka had technical knowledge and prior experience of building a community which was pivotal in how BSL is shaped and structured today.

Tit for Tat has been going on (Warning Campaign under every TFT recruitment post that liked people are above to rules and donation only benefit the owner, website, multiple operation, better recruitment influx, tracking the dictator's every move on steam... getting him ban from steam discussion for few days)... i'm not gonna lie it was a bloodbath.

## Ceasar Wins

Orka was very critical of Brandon behavior with some members and how he was just copying TFT and just becoming as bad... Only 2 weeks in...

The next morning Orka was banned, BloodyMystik was banned and later that day Brandon nuked the server!

All of the hours of development by BloodyMystik and Orka gone...

All the work Pride, Sammy and others gone!

Initially, BloodyMystik predicted Bryson would be the problem to his very good surprise! Bryson was level headed and great second in command to metigate issues with the neo-dictator, Brandon... Bryson understood the big picture and was ready to work in achieving it...


The death of Archer was also the death of Bryson growing maturity and respect.

BloodyMystik said once "If Bryson had put the same effort in BSL as he did in Archer he would have been a top g... it's such a waste to see a guy of such potential being affected by petty parties and an ass hole like Brando"

2 Weeks in and no more Archer... the good news travels back to TFT and it's a victory! they are prepare with firm hands a welcome back wagon, apology letters and defeated faces to show up!
