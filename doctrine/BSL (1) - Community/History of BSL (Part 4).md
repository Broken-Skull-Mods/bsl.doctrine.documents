## The Birth of Broken Skull Lunatics

**BloodyMystik** created the newly named **Broken Skull Mods**, which was later rebranded to **Broken Skull Lunatics**.

- **Broken** refers to the **TFT** logo that we've broken.
- **Skull** references the skull in the **TFT** logo, which was semi-stolen from *Ghost Recon Wildlands*.
- **Lunatics** represents our people—crazy, delusional, and undefeatable.

**BloodyMystik**, **Orka**, and **Sammy** quickly seized the power vacuum created by **Brandon’s** destruction of **Archer Company**, which he could have transferred to **Bryson** or any of us. Instead, like a selfish, self-centered bastard, he destroyed it.

Given what had happened, **BloodyMystik** decided that the community needed someone level-headed, who wouldn’t make rash decisions at the expense of everyone else. Bloody said, *"I'm sick of dumb fuckers screwing everything up instead of growing, so I'm not joining anyone else's unit."* With **Sammy’s** support, the remnants of **Archer** flocked over to **BSL**.

**Sammy**, **Orka**, **Just1n**, and **BloodyMystik** built most of the current structure of the **BSL** community discord.

**Special Operations Framework** was implemented into the mission-making process, and **BSL** began tapping into the **TFT** dictator’s paranoia... an easy target!

## Tit for Tat (BSL vs TFT)

- **Apollo** attempted to join our community in disguise.
- **Pride** attempted to join theirs.
- The dictator accused **BSL** of stirring shit.
- **BSL** reminded **TFT** that **Apollo** instigated the issues.
- **Apollo** joined our **Arma 3** servers.
- **Pride** joined their community.
- **BSL** was accused of creating false accounts, without any proof, which led to the kicking of **TFT** members under "false" suspicion.
- **Sammy** was kicked while away on deployment for no apparent reason.
- **Snow** was also kicked while away on deployment for no apparent reason.
- Several other members were kicked as well.
- **TFT** was made aware that **Apollo** was stirring shit, but no action was taken.
- **TFT** made it clear that, no matter what, **Apollo** was more valued by the dictator, even though he caused the **BSL** migration in the first place.
- **Brandon** joined **BSL**, and we considered his behavior water under the bridge. However, he also joined **TFT** and stirred more shit.
- **Brandon** eventually left **BSL**, throwing all the blame on **BloodyMystik**.
- **TFT** trashed **BloodyMystik** as the problem.
- **BloodyMystik** informed **TFT** about letting a snake like **Brandon** back into the fold.
- **BSL** ditched the **TFT** domain by handing it to a trusted third party, symbolizing our growth past **TFT** and moving on.
- A few weeks after **Brandon** left, **TFT** started its now-defunct unit.

*Note: **Apollo** is so hated that if someone joins **BSL** with the name **Apollo**, they will be kicked.* ;)

## Sawing the Branch We’re Sitting On

**BSL** went through a difficult and horrible **Saturday mission** experience...

As a new community, many people were changing things, trying to be different from **TFT**, at the expense of the serious **Saturday Milsim experience** we were aiming for.

*It is my personal opinion that ditching training and not properly laying down the foundation destroyed the experience I was looking for! The experience **TFT** provided, that **BSL** consistently failed to provide. An experience of belonging to a team that is consistent and competent.*

That failure caused extreme changes and bad decisions. The ops started out well, but various issues surrounding the mission setup led to a terrible experience due to bad settings, bad zeusing, poor RP, lack of ground information, and lack of will to restrict **Saturday** to training-focused ops.

**Pride’s** consistent influx of new members diluted the core group of old members without providing proper training and operational success.

## Growing Casualism

**Pride’s** recruitment of his golden recruit **Tex** brought 80% of the recruits to **BSL**, in addition to making **Sunday ops** more casual.

**Tex** made the best of the casual operations, but the same casual attendees also showed up to **Saturday** ops, which were meant to be **Milsim**. Without training, a unified vision, or a solid system, this led to a wedge being driven between the more Milsim-oriented members and the casual players. Eventually, Milsim had to reform its system to find common ground through lengthy discussions.

The failure of **Saturday operations** to implement **Milsim** with a now majority-casual player base, lacking discipline and proper leadership, was a complete disaster. I thank all **BSL** members who put up with this and contributed every day to fix and improve it as a collective.

There’s plenty of blame to go around, but when **Sammy** left for deployment, **Just1n** worked tirelessly to keep the community going and support mod development.

**Just1n** earned his place as a prime example of a man stepping up to take on more than he could chew and failing without giving up!

At that time, **Orka** was having issues with many members, not enough to prompt complaints about him, but enough to become a growing problem. On many issues, **Orka** had been right.

Remember, **Orka** built the **Council System** and helped build the entire structure of **BSL**.

At this point, **Sammy** was gone for 9 months, and we had a community dominated by casual players. The only good operations were **Sunday casual ops**.

Many of the Milsim recruits left because they wanted a Milsim-style unit like **TFT**, with a game structure and discord structure where NCOs held as much power in the server as in-game.

The remaining Milsim players were either no longer showing up (e.g., **Bloody**, **Orka**, **J**, **Sammy**, **Systm**, and **Frosl**) for various reasons...

## The Mods Split

Diversity makes you grow better. Hearing and taking what you deem good from the side you don’t like, and vice versa, makes you a better community.

We now have more than 34 mods published on the **Arma 3** workshop thanks to **BloodyMystik** and **Orka**.
