## The Birth of Broken Skull Lunatics

BloodyMystik created the newly called Broken Skull Mods which was later rebranded Broken Skull Lunatics...

- Broken reference the logo of TFT that we have broken.
- Skull reference the logo of TFT, skull semi stolen from Ghost Recon Wildlands.
- Lunatics is our people, crazy, delusional and shall not be defeated.

BloodyMystik was very decisive and swift the grab the power vaccum created by Brandon nuking of Archer Company, which he could've transfered to Bryson or any of us instead like a fucking selfish self centered bastard he destroyed it.

Based on what happen BloodyMystik decided, we need someone level headed whom will not be taking rash decision at the expense of everyone and Bloody said "I'm sick of dumb fuckers screwing everything up instead of growing so im not joining anyone else's unit" and with Sammy support the remnant of Archer flocked over to BSL.

Sammy, Orka, Just1n and Bloody built most current structure of the community discord.

Special Operation Framework was implemented into the mission making process.

BSL were taping into TFT dictator's paranoia... easy target!

## Tit for Tat (BSL vs TFT)

- Apollo attempting to join our community in disguise.
- Pride attempting to join theirs.
- Dictator accusing BSL of stiring shit.
- BSL reminding TFT that Apollo instigated shit.
- Apollo joining our Arma 3 servers.
- Pride joining their comunity.
- BSL accused of creating false account, without any proof which was lame reason to kick some of TFT members under "false" suspicion.
- Sammy was kicked while away on deployment for no apparent reason.
- Snow was kicked while away on deployment fo no apparent reason.
- Some other were kicked as well.
- TFT being made aware that Apollo stirs shit and no action is taken from.
- TFT made it clear no matter what Apollo can do he is more valued in the dictator's eyes even tho he cause the BSL migration in the first place.
- Brandon joins BSL and BSL consider his behavior as water under the bridge which he also join TFT and stirred more shit.
- Brandon leaves BSL.
- Brandon threw all the blame on BloodyMystik all of it.
- TFT trashing BloodyMystik as to problem...
- BloodyMystik informing TFT of let a snake like Brandon back to TFT.
- BSL ditching TFT domain to a trusted third party to deliver to TFT as an attempt to get rid of TFT as we grew way past this group and are moving on.
- Few week after Brandon left TFT and start his now new dead unit.

## Sawing Branch We Sitting On
BSL went through a bad, a bad and a horrible Saturday mission experience...

As a new community, lots of people has been changing things, trying to be different than TFT at the expanse of the experience of Saturday serious milsim exp.

It is my personal opinion that *Ditching training, not properly sitting down to laydown proper foundation destroyed the experience i was looking for! The experience TFT provided that BSL was consistenly failing to provide. An experience or belonging to a team consistent and competent*.

That failure cause extreme changes and bad decisions... the ops started very good... but the various issues surrounding the mission was a setup for a terrible experience between the bad settings, bad zeusing, bad RP, lack of ground information... lack of will to restrict saturday behind training wall.

Pride consistent influx of new members deluting the old members without any training and consistent operational success.

## Growing Casualism

Pride recruitment of his golden recruit Tex brought 80% of the recruits to BSL in addition of making Sunday ops.

Tex's made the best of operations as casual which the same casual people attended Saturday meant to be milsim... no training failing to have a unified vision and at least a unified system.

Wedge being caved between the more milsims and the more casuals and failure to find common ground until milsim caved to reform their system and find some common ground through lengthy talks.

The failure of Saturday operations to implement milsim with a now majority casual players, lacking discipline and lacking proper leadership with proper information was a complete disaster, which i thank all member of BSl that put up with this and contributing everyday to fix and make it better as a collective.

There is a lot of blame to throw around but... when Sammy left for deployment, Just1n worked everyday swaet and tears to keep that community going and supporting the mod development section of BSL!

Just1n more than earned his place and this is the prime example of a man stepping up to take more than he can chew and failing without giving up!

At that time, Orka was fighting with a lot of members, not enough to get members to complain about him but enough to grow into a becoming problem which on many issues Orka had been right.

Remember that Orka built the Council System and help build the whole structure.

At that point Sammy is gone for 9 months, we have now a community of dominant casual players and the only ops good are casual sundays!

Many of the Milsim recruit left because of wanting a Milsim unit like TFT game structure are discord struture and NCO holds the power in the server just as much as in game...

The remaining Milsim are either no longer showing (Bloody, Orka, J, Sammy, Systm and Frosl...) for various reasons...

## The Mods Split

Diversity makes you grow better... hearing and taking what you deem good from the side you dont like vice versa makes you become better.

We have now more than 34 Mods publish on workshop for Arma 3 thanks to BloodyMystik and Orka.
