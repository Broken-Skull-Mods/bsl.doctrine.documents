## The Drunk Pride Yappin

Late night, after several drinks Pride having good conversation with the dictatory... the balls on that guy! Conversation evolves into tell the dictatory what is wrong with this his leadership, why there will be a real coup this time and why people hate the motherbuzzer... some truth and some distorted truth in the vibe of filling the blank...

Ultimately Pride gets himself booted from TFT and the dictator is on the hunt to find out if Pride is an all out liar or if there is a coup coming up!

Most of the people mentioned flat out tell the dictator Pride is a lying bastard and everything he said is bullshit...

The dictatory conclude that Pride is a liar and there is nothing wrong with TFT and everything is absolutely fine!

While BloodyMystik tries to talk to the dictatory to tell him... that that is the wrong conclusion because no matter what is true and not true... if the situation happened that means self reflection is advised... but who's gonna tell a dictator the truth...

## The Archer Company Coup
In the meantime,
Brandon and Bryson created the Archer Company unit where Brandon is the head of the server...

Brandon invites Orka and then few days/weeks later they invite BloodyMystk, Just1n, Sammy, Pride and other members.

BloodyMystik & Orka sees that as an opportunity push Special Operation Framework mod into full testing while working hand in hand with mission makers which shaped the mod to become a mission maker toolkit.

Just1n saw that as an opportunity to continue the community missions and to get away from Apollo's unbearable voice!

Sammy was like hell yeah let's make RP stuff and have good time with the boys!

Orka and BloodyMystik are trying to shape the community to more what BSL is today.

While little by little Pride is recruiting left and right draining TFT of almost half of it's active members.

TFT most loyal members stayed... which BloodyMystik theorized as because they did not spend that much time around the dictator they could not be converted as they did not see the issue or were not exposed as much as the rest of us did.

Understand that Bryson and Brandon were NCOs over TFT and it left open a power vaccum which Apollo got circled it like fly circle a pile of shit.

BloodyMystik tried to help TFT for a long time,

- Starting with buying the domain name for the unit in hope or developing the community's web presence while the donation system of TFT only benefit the dictator not the community...
- By developing mods which always was dismissed and frown upon.
- By hosting teamspeak server which was never used for some reasons.
- By offering to mass produce mousepad at no extra charge than cost refunded upon selling them to help out his majesty to grow his personal empire!

The full blown coup is now known by TFT, some left some stayed in both and some got the boot.
