# The Founders
Everyone likes a little bit of drama here and there, and this is ours!

**Broken Skull Lunatics** was founded by:
- [BloodyMystik](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971902294/)
- [Sammy Dorito](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971902294/)
- [Orka](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198268088665/)
- [Just1n](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Just1n_L/)

The group was founded on April 1st, 2024, and it was no April Fool's joke, we promise!

## The Donation System
BSL has a unique donation system rarely seen elsewhere!

- **No benefits for the owners:** None of the BSL founders benefit from donations. All donations go toward providing services and content for the community!
- **Approved Budget:** Donating members must approve a budget, and the funds must be used for services such as servers, licenses, and other community-related expenses.
- **Community-Driven:** Members can donate by offering free services like servers, and BSL-owned services are managed solely by the Ultimate Discord Owner via the council command, which answers to the voted budget.

## Critical Events
This is the chronological order of the events that led to the creation of **Broken Skull Lunatics**. Anyone telling you a different story is a lying bastard!

### The TFT Meet Up!
- **TFT:** BloodyMystik, Sammy Dorito, Orka, and Just1n all met in a unit called TFT (not to advertise that nonsense of a unit).
- **Dictatorship:** TFT operated under a dictatorship, and for some of us, it was the first Arma 3 unit. TFT wasn’t inherently bad, but the leadership had a narrow, paranoid view that hindered community growth.
- **Community Needs:** Brandon, whom we consider a community organizer, created Arma 3 missions for casual play, but there was no way to announce or organize these events within TFT. We had no dedicated section for community-generated content.

### The War Party Coup
- **Frustration with TFT:** After struggling to gain a dedicated section for the community within TFT, Orka created the **War Party** Discord to give the community a space to organize and announce community-made missions. This was done without any malicious intent, simply to fulfill a growing need.
- **Testing Special Operations Framework:** For BloodyMystik and Orka, War Party also became a testing ground for a mod called **Special Operations Framework**, which was in desperate need of active multiplayer testing that TFT couldn’t provide due to its leadership’s refusal to support it.
- **Dictator’s Paranoia:** The TFT leader's paranoia led him to see the War Party as a coup attempt, which was completely fabricated by Apollo, a lackey trying to gain favor. This led to another fracture within TFT and forced a migration of community members.
- **War Party Closed:** Eventually, TFT agreed to host missions and announce community events on its server, but the damage was done. The community members lost trust in the leadership.

### The War Party Aftermath
- **Brandon’s Return to TFT:** Brandon returned to TFT with all the bells and whistles, but the dictator saw it as a dodged bullet. He couldn’t see the long-term effects of his actions.
- **Broken Relationship:** The accusations made by the dictator that Brandon was orchestrating a coup broke their relationship beyond repair. The logo Bloody created for War Party also worsened things, reinforcing the dictator’s belief that War Party was a threat.
- **Division in the Community:** Brandon continued to manage community games and events, but the leadership's resistance to community-driven initiatives fostered resentment among members.

## The Birth of Broken Skull Lunatics (BSL)
- After the breakdown in TFT, the founders recognized the need for a new community that allowed for creativity, collaboration, and freedom without the oppressive control of a dictator.
- **BSL Was Born:** Broken Skull Lunatics was established to create an open, collaborative space for gamers, where donations went directly to improving the community, and the leaders prioritized the collective good over personal gain.
