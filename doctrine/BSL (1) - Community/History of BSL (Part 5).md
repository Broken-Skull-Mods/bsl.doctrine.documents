## Broken Relationships

The fall of **Orka** was deeply upsetting for many of us.

As a founding member, a modding contributor, and a key figure, **Orka** eventually stopped participating and contributing as a Council Member.

He refused to comply with the system and rules that were voted on by the Council—the same council and system he had helped to build and design. 

A man must respect both his decisions and the collaborative process within a collective.

**Orka’s** diminished involvement forced the Council to vote him out of his position, which was a great disappointment. 

When commitment wanes, one should step down with dignity instead of being forced out, which only fosters resentment towards whatever may be wrong.

**Orka** also stopped contributing to the development of **Special Operations Framework**.

He became a victim of his own system, resenting someone who was working tirelessly to enhance the community—learning from mistakes and constantly improving based on feedback.

Leadership distanced itself, and no effort was made to repair the broken relationship with a founding member.

From what I’ve gathered, **Orka** has faded into a mere shadow of the person he once was—a ghost of the past—serving as a poignant reminder of how easily relationships can fracture and the irreparable damage that can follow when trust and commitment are lost.

**Orka** returned to **TFT**, where he seemed to flourish, even securing an Officer position—a role of considerable power and influence. This raises unsettling questions: Could his return have been part of a carefully crafted plan? Perhaps **Orka** isn’t just a former member, but a genius mastermind orchestrating moves behind the scenes, playing a much deeper game than any of us realized.

My conclusion is that **Orka** found the complexities of building a community too overwhelming, especially when it required balancing diverse perspectives and setting aside his own ego. What I gathered is that he sought a system where his ideas were unquestioned, but that kind of autonomy wasn’t possible in a collaborative environment. Realizing this, he likely found it easier to fall back into the role of being the right-hand man to a dictator, where power is consolidated and decisions are simpler—no need for compromise or consensus, just unquestioned loyalty and control.

We lost not just a friend, a founder, and a valuable member—we lost a key part of our foundation, a driving force that helped shape what we were. This isn’t just a personal loss; it’s a loss for everyone involved, a fracture in something that could have been far greater. And that, without a doubt, is the greatest tragedy of all.
