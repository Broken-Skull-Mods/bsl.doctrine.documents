## Broken Relationships

The fall of Orka was very upsetting to many of us.

Orka as a founding member, a modding member and a contributor stop contributing and participating as Council Member.

Orka refused to comply with the system and rules voted by the Council, the same council and system he help build and design... A man must respect his decisions and the process when collaborating with a collective.

Orka diminishing participation as a council member forced the council to vote him our of his position which was a shame, a great shame also! When you are no longer committed you shall resign by yourself in dignity instead being forced out and grow his own resentment towards what ever is wrong.

Orka stop participating to the development of Special Operation Framework.

Victim of his own system, hating the guy who's working day in night to better the community... regardless of the mistakes made and improving himself upon feedback time and time again...

Leadership distanced themselves and no one worked in repairing the broken relationship with a founding member!


As far as i know, Orka is a shadow of a member, a remenant of the past and a reminder that relationships are fragile.

Orka returned the TFT where he has a blast and none the less has a Officer position which is very high... some may even wonder if all of it wasn't just a long con in the making.

My conclusion is that Orka saw that building a community was too much work and dealing with diversity is more complex... What i understood he wanted is democracy that dictated but his own ideas... he could not have that and realize that TFT was not so bad...

We lost a friend, a founder and a valuable member that is the greatest shame.
