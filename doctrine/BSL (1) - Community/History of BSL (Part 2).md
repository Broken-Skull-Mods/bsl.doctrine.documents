## The Drunk Pride Yappin

One late night, after several drinks, Pride had a good conversation with the dictator... the audacity of that guy! The conversation evolved into a frank discussion about what was wrong with the dictator’s leadership, why a real coup was about to happen, and why people hated the motherbuzzer. Some of what Pride said was true, while other parts were distorted to fill in the blanks.

Ultimately, Pride got himself booted from TFT, and the dictator went on a hunt to determine if Pride was a complete liar or if a coup was truly coming.

Most of the people Pride mentioned flat out told the dictator that he was lying, and everything he said was bullshit. 

The dictator concluded that Pride was a liar and that there was nothing wrong with TFT, believing everything was perfectly fine.

Meanwhile, **BloodyMystik** tried to speak to the dictator, explaining that even if some of Pride's claims were false, the fact that the situation had occurred meant self-reflection was necessary. But who's going to tell a dictator the truth?

## The Archer Company Coup

In the meantime, Brandon and Bryson created the **Archer Company** unit, with Brandon as the head of the server. 

Brandon invited Orka, and a few days/weeks later, they invited BloodyMystik, Just1n, Sammy, Pride, and other members.

- **BloodyMystik** and **Orka** saw this as an opportunity to push the **Special Operations Framework mod** into full testing while working closely with mission makers to shape the mod into a toolkit for future mission creators.
- **Just1n** viewed this as an opportunity to continue creating community missions and escape from Apollo's unbearable voice.
- **Sammy** was on board, thinking it would be a great chance to create RP content and have fun with the boys.
- **Orka** and **BloodyMystik** were working to shape the community into what **BSL** is today.

Meanwhile, Pride was recruiting left and right, draining **TFT** of almost half of its active members. 

TFT's most loyal members remained, and **BloodyMystik** theorized that this was because those members had spent less time around the dictator and were either unaware of the issues or hadn’t been exposed to them as much as others had.

It’s important to note that Bryson and Brandon were NCOs in **TFT**, which left a power vacuum that **Apollo** quickly capitalized on, circling it like a fly around a pile of shit.

**BloodyMystik** had tried to help **TFT** for a long time, including:

- Purchasing the domain name for the unit in the hope of developing the community’s web presence, while the donation system in **TFT** only benefited the dictator, not the community.
- Developing mods that were consistently dismissed and frowned upon.
- Hosting a TeamSpeak server that was never used for reasons unknown.
- Offering to mass-produce mousepads at no extra charge, with costs refunded upon selling them, to help grow the dictator’s personal empire.

Eventually, the full-blown coup was evident to **TFT**. Some members left, some stayed in both communities, and some got the boot.
